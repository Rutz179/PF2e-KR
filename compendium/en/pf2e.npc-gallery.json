An expert in travel through difficult environments, the Rain-Scribe provides for their companions while helping them avoid the many hazards of travel in the Inner Sea. Rain-Scribes are some of the most well-traveled members of the academy, and most have secured alliances or promises of safe passage through the lands where they walk.</p>\n<p>Should the Rain-Scribe or their companions be attacked on their journeys, the scribe is a capable combatant who strives to turn their communion with the natural world into their greatest advantage in battle. Whether by using primal magic against their foes or striking unseen from the underbrush, the Rain-Scribe assures that no opponent threatens their traveling companions for long.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Incredible events have rocked the lands of Avistan over the past 10 years, from whole cities reappearing out of a loop in time to magical explosions vaporizing the prison of Gallowspire. These marvels, both terrible and awe inspiring, inevitably attracted the attention of the Magaambya academy, home of scholars of magic in all its forms. Scholars, emissaries, and spies alike have now established Magaambyan centers in the north, seeking to learn and to help those they can along the way.</p>",

Privateers work for their own profit and reputation, of course, but they also commit themselves to keeping the sea-lanes free from navies that strive to enforce land law on the unbounded waves. Tyrants and slavers are their favorite targets, and many a greedy colonizer or trafficker in flesh has been sent to the bottom of the sea after the captain liberated their cargo. Generally, however, the privateer captain is willing to spare prisoners so that they might be ransomed and spread tales of Firebrands' actions across the region.</p>\n<p>The privateer captain is often at the vanguard of boarding parties. Many call on the power of the fickle goddess Besmara to strengthen their crew in battle and sanctify each shipboard raid. As at home in water as on deck, a privateer captain will gladly leap into the sea to pursue a foe or rescue a fallen crewmate. Though the privateer captain might run under a false flag or attempt to deceive a foe before battle, they generally honor agreements to surrender and make a point to keep their word, particularly when dealing with other Firebrands.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Wherever oppression or an opportunity for daring adventure can be found, the Firebrands can be found chasing after.

The charming scoundrel presented here could easily be a low level freedom fighter or foil for the PCs, or might serve as crew for the privateer captain.

Generally found on the coast, azarketis favor life near a major body of water, as keeping their skin hydrated is a biological requirement. Though most azarketis live relatively peaceful lives of fishing or farming, they sometimes need to defend their homes against hostile forces, and some leave their communities to become adventurers. The following statistics may be used to represent commonly encountered azarketis.</p>\n<p>Azarketis with more adventurous spirits often learn the art of sailing and join the crew of a ship. Such sailors get to enjoy their time above deck while also having near-constant access to large bodies of water.

Within the order, the word of these figures is law, and members from the lowliest squire to the most senior knight follow commands from a paravicar with unswerving devotion. Paravicars see their personal dedication to the order's edicts as an example for all members and hold themselves to the same high standards as their underlings. Though they seldom need to call upon them, paravicars use their considerable infernal powers to reinforce their positions in the Hellknight's hierarchy.</p>\n<p>In combat, paravicars take direct command of their troops of knights and armigers. Paravicars are experienced campaigners who prefer calculated tactical gambits to hot-headed, risky maneuvers that could leave their forces exposed. If pressed into combat, paravicars use their abilities to demoralize their foes and compel enemies to become their allies or to flee the field.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Firm believers in enforcing the law at any cost, Hellknights are often based in Cheliax, but they travel to all across Golarion to enforce their ideals of order. This rigid viewpoint and intolerance for dissent means that PCs can just as easily find villains in these Hellknights as they can allies; an agent of the Hellknight Order of the Chain might aid the PCs in subduing a vile and violent criminal, or might hunt down the PCs due to mild infractions of unjust laws. The Hellknight armiger presented here might be an unrepentant enforcer seeking to quell rebellion among the oppressed, a dedicated monster hunter, a censor of artistic innovation, a savior to victims of kidnapping, a spy and torturer, or a lawful crusader against demonic incursions.
