It was this corruption of the cycle of souls that spawned the first sahkils.</p>\n<p>Ambivalent to the prescribed order of the multiverse and spiteful of mortals, sahkils delight in spreading fear and unease to all beings, clogging up the metaphysical cycle with anxiety-ridden mortals too scared to achieve their potential. These fiends have drastically changed from their dedicated psychopomp predecessors. They are creatures of spite and torment, fear and disgust. They exploit the most common and rare fears for their own perverse satisfaction, and they want nothing more than to frighten mortals and make them quetion their reason for existence.</p>\n<p>Most sahkils lurk on the Ethereal Plane, but they frequently invade the Material Plane to torment mortals and spread terror. They use their innate ability to slip between the veils of the Ethereal and Material effortlessly, often stalking their targets for days or weeks before enacting their devious plots.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pakalchis strive to intensify their preys' inherent insecurity over personal and emotional bonds, playing on the threat of those relationships falling into ruin. These sahkils are among the most manipulative of their kind, pulling strings both literal and figurative on their victims over stretched-out periods of time, exhilarating in the despair and fear for as long as possible.</p>",
