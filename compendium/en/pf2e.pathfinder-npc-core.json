While many kholos live up to the terrible stories of their ferocity and cannibalism, others are scavengers and trappers just trying to get by. Many of their cultural traditions are misunderstood by other ancestries, and some kholos play into the fear provoked in those who believe the twisted tales about their people. Kholos are often criticized for their lack of honor in battle, but a kholo understands honor doesn't bring you back home alive, nor does honor put food on the table. Ambushes, feints, and deceptions that lead to fewer kholo deaths and a quicker victory are simply the logical thing to do.</p>",
