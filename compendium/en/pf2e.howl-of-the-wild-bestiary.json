Although generally effective as a warning to nearby predators, these sharp cries also serve as a lure for reckless alchemists eager to study the creature's potent enzymes.</p>\n<p>Flynketts' name, most theorize, is a corruption of \"flinging kettle\" or \"flying kettle.\" They can't truly fly, instead using their skin flaps to glide in a manner similar to flying squirrels. However, the primary use of their skin flaps isn't for movement, but digestion. When it rains, flynketts roll up their loose skin, creating a crude sort of kettle in which to catch precipitation. The remarkable creatures' acid combines with the falling water to break down wood, soil, or even rocks into a nutritional stew. Therefore, the flynkett can flourish when introduced to any environment with frequent rain, something solid to stand on, and a lack of natural predators.</p>\n<p>Although their acid can be harvested without harming a flynkett, the creatures rarely cooperate. If disturbed, particularly in the middle of feeding, they release clouds of acidic steam. They're also capable of spitting the fluid with deadly accuracy. Thankfully for those who run afoul of them, flynketts have no use for corpses and will generally break off pursuit when the interloper leaves their territory.</p>\n<p>Several organizations and individual scholars have desperately sought to domesticate flynketts for use in alchemical production. To date, none of these efforts have been successful, though several abandoned labs still contain aggressive packs of flynketts who protect their new territory with ferocious tenacity.</p>",

This line of thinking has led to an increase in almiraj attacks as local citizens try to capture the creature alive and remove the horn, hoping this will turn it into a more docile hare.

Apothecary bee workers are about a foot long, with yellow and black stripes. While carrying a potion, the bee's abdomen visibly swells and often changes color to match the potion within.</p>\n<p>The value of the apothecary bees' potions has led to numerous attempts at domestication, a dangerous, expensive dream with both high risks and high rewards. Once a magical garden has been established, apothecary beehives tend to become self-sustaining. Beekeepers can potentially guide their cultivation, but they're no longer necessary for the hive's survival. Some ancient, long-abandoned gardens still grow along the Sphinx River in Osirion, where many apothecary bees prowl for flowers that meet their standards. Upon their most recent dig to the surface, surki communities quickly began the process of \"trading\" with the bees, establishing habitats and using their natural magic sense to better tend the massive fields a large hive needs. Miflits, on the other hand, often end up absorbed into the bees' social structure.</p>\n<p>The potions a hive produces vary from season to season, depending on what flowers are available. Beekeepers have made strides in creating gardens that yield specific potions and have even developed harvesting techniques that increase potion effectiveness. These techniques are valuable, closely guarded secrets, but even defective potions with cursed results have found use among the followers of Calistria and Norgorber.</p>",
